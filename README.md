# Document ShAIRing System
A group project for CSC 32200: Software Engineering. The project requires us to create a file sharing system with different user privileges and a command-based version tracker.

## Getting Started
To clone the repository, enter the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/rayangler/document-shairing-system
```
Make sure to have Node.js with npm installed. You can use Homebrew, downloaded from https://brew.sh/. Use `brew install node` to get the latest version of Node and npm. Alternatively, Node can also be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/.

To make sure Node and npm were installed properly, use the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
After Node and npm are properly installed, go to the cloned directory and use `npm install` to install of the dependencies and packages needed for the project to work.
